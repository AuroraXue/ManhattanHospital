In this second project of GU4243/GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop an app called QUALICARE. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization based on hospital Quality Indicator data based on shiny app, by using U.S. government open data released on the [data.gov](https://data.gov/) website. See [Project 2 Description](project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:
